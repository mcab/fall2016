## Happy Number

The sum of the squares of the digits of a number either eventually converge to 1 or continue in a loop.

happyNumber.class is the implementation of this, while happyNumberTest.class tests on it.

**Run**: java happyNumberTest

Modifying happyNumberTest.java to see how it reacts should work fine.
